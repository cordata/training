# Further Reading
HIPAA will continue to evolve. We will try our best to keep up with it and ensure our documentation is up to date. We encourage you, as part of the Cordata team, to read up on it occasionally as well. Notify the Chief Privacy Officer and Chief Security Officer if you notice any discrepancies.
